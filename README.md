Python‑based gesture controller that maps real‑time face, hand, and head movements to keyboard (including arrow keys) and mouse events for seamless desktop navigation and gaming.
This Python‑based controller lets you navigate your computer and play desktop games using real‑time face, hand, and head gestures. It captures live video with OpenCV, extracts landmarks via MediaPipe, and maps your movements—like hand swipes or nods—to keyboard events (including arrow key navigation) and mouse actions. With on‑the‑fly calibration and customizable gesture‑to‑action profiles, it delivers smooth, low‑latency control that makes both gaming and general computer use more intuitive and accessible.
